### 🚦 About Me

- 💻 **Software Engineer** by profession, always learning—currently studying Computer Science.
- 🛠️ **Thorough system design** is my forte: event-driven architectures, distributed systems, and reliability-first automation.
- ⚡ I believe in considering as many risks to reliability and stability as possible before implementation, because the best solutions anticipate problems before they happen.
- 🧠 My approach balances rigorous due diligence (scaling, performance, fallback strategies) with pragmatic delivery; avoiding overengineering, but never cutting corners on core stability.

---

### 🛠️ Core Skills

- **Languages:** Java (primary), Python (recent), shell scripting
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SurrealDB, Neo4j (graph, relational, and schemaless)
- **System Design:** Event-driven with RabbitMQ, streamable HTTP RPC, REST & Websocket APIs
- **DevOps:** Kubernetes, Docker, Proxmox, VPNs, certificates, distributed hosting (on-prem + VPS)
- **Consulting:** Translating archaic business workflows into robust, future-proof IT systems

---

### 🌱 Favorite Projects

- **Automation Backend (Proprietary)**  
  My most rewarding project: architected and built an automation system from the ground up for SMBs - a true reliability workhorse and a core selling point for the business.  
  *(Sadly, I can’t share the code, but ask me about automation challenges!)*

### 🏡 Homelab

- Extensive on-premise + remote setups
- Bare-metal, Kubernetes, Docker, and Proxmox orchestration
- Wildcard certificates, custom VPNs, and distributed admin

### 🌿 On Reliability & Design

> “The best solutions are born from thoughtful design and foresight.  
> Every risk considered before implementation saves countless hours down the line.”
